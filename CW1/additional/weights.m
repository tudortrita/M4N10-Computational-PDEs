% Calculates FD weights. The parameters are:
% z location where approximations are to be accurate,
% x vector with x-coordinates for grid points,
% m highest derivative that we want to find weights for
% c array size (m+1,length(x)), containing (as output) in
% successive rows the weights for derivatives 0,1,...,m.
